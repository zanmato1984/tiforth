# TiKV Adapter

This directory defines the TiKV-facing adapter boundary.

The adapter should eventually translate TiKV expression and operator behavior into shared specs and contracts without turning adapter code into the semantic source of truth.

Current checkpoint:

- the first shared adapter boundary in `adapters/first-expression-slice.md` remains intentionally limited to TiDB and TiFlash
- `adapters/first-expression-slice-tikv.md` now defines the first TiKV-specific request and response boundary for `first-expression-slice`
- `docs/design/adapter-milestone-breakdown.md` records why TiKV follows the initial TiDB/TiFlash pairwise checkpoint sequence
- `docs/design/adapter-runtime-orchestration-boundary.md` fixes which TiKV environment, timeout, retry, cancellation, and diagnostic concerns should stay adapter-local

Next checkpoint:

- implement one TiKV single-engine adapter path that executes documented `first-expression-slice` cases into normalized `case result` records

## TODOs

- document TiKV-specific semantic mismatches found during inventory
- extend the TiKV request and response surface beyond `first-expression-slice` after the first executable checkpoint is reviewable
