# TiKV Adapter

This directory defines the TiKV-facing adapter boundary.

The adapter should eventually translate TiKV expression and operator behavior into shared specs and contracts without turning adapter code into the semantic source of truth.

Current checkpoint:

- the first shared adapter boundary in `adapters/first-expression-slice.md` remains intentionally limited to TiDB and TiFlash
- `adapters/first-expression-slice-tikv.md` now defines the first TiKV-specific request and response boundary for `first-expression-slice`
- `docs/design/adapter-milestone-breakdown.md` records why TiKV follows the initial TiDB/TiFlash pairwise checkpoint sequence
- `docs/design/adapter-runtime-orchestration-boundary.md` fixes which TiKV environment, timeout, retry, cancellation, and diagnostic concerns should stay adapter-local
- `crates/tiforth-adapter-tikv` now encodes `first-expression-slice` request catalogs with TiKV-oriented SQL lowering and row / error normalization behind a runner boundary
- `inventory/first-expression-slice-tikv-compat-notes.md` now captures the first TiKV-side compatibility notes checkpoint for `first-expression-slice`
- `inventory/first-expression-slice-tikv-case-results.json` now captures the first checked-in TiKV single-engine normalized `case-results` evidence for `first-expression-slice`

Next checkpoint:

- define TiKV pairwise drift aggregation policy for `first-expression-slice` now that single-engine TiKV `case-results` evidence is checked in

## TODOs

- execute the first TiKV pairwise drift checkpoint after pairwise policy and comparison scope are accepted
- extend the TiKV request and response surface beyond `first-expression-slice` after the first executable checkpoint and compatibility notes are reviewable
